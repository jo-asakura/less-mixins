# LESS-Mixins

LESS-Mixins is a [collection](mixins.less) of LESS mixins and variables for quickly writing CSS. It serves as a lightweight and interface agnostic approach to jumpstarting your next web project. Use it how you see fit.

## Getting started

LESS-Mixins collection requires original [LESS](http://lesscss.org) library to work. Navigate to official documentation and get familiar with the language. Once you're ready to start coding, include LESS-Misins collection and have fun.

1. Create a new LESS file (e.g., styles.less);
2. Include LESS-Mixins via `@import "less-mixins.less";`;
3. Start writing your own LESS-flavored CSS using prebuilt mixins.

You don't need to use any normalize libraries since LESS-Mixins includes both HTML4 and HTML5 resets.

All the mixins are well-documented; therefore, go through the library and familiarize youself with it.

## Additinal libraries

I've also uploaded some useful LESS collections besides mixins:

- [Media Queries/Responsive Design](media.less) starting point, so you can start developing on a prebuilt scaffolding;
- [Flat UI colors](flat-ui-colors.less) is a collection of FlatUI variables for you to use;
- [Entypo font-icon defintions](entypo.less) provides you with a predefined entypo icons.
